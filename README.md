### Assets with animated captions

![aiaa-hover-captions-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43cef1d7-aa2a-4b97-8762-c0f2f2095c24)

You can add assets whose captions show up with a transition effect over the asset when you hover them.

To do this, you just have to add a "Group" block to your page, then assign a class `image-hover-text` to this block, and optionally, a color class for the overlay: `secondary`, `complementary` or `primary`. If no color class is assigned, it'll default to `secondary`.

Finally add 3 blocks to the Group:
1. Asset block: The image.
2. HTML block: The content that will show up in the animated caption on hover the image. It must have an `<h4>` heading in order for it to be previewed over the image.
3. HTML block: Another HTML block just to add the link. It will be rendered as an arrow button.

### Colored Captions

Captions in blocks like "**Asset**", "**Item Carousel**", and "**Media Embed**" are rendered with a color background (secondary by default).

You can customize this color (complementary or primary) by assigning either `caption-complementary` or `caption-primary` class to the block in the "Block layout configuration" panel.

### Group blocks with color background

You can add Group blocks and assign some specific classes in order for them to have a solid color background:
- `has-background`: Class to assign the group block a solid color background.
- `<color>`: The solid color to assign to the background. It can be `secondary`, `primary` or `complementary`. If no color class is assigned, it'll default to `secondary`.

Optionally, you can add the `fullwidth` class to make it look full width (within the theme default container).

**Note:** By default, Omeka S offers a "Background" setting in the "Block layout configuration" panel where you can assign a custom color (3- or 6-digit hexadecimal color). However, we recommend using the color classes mentioned above in order to preserve this theme's look&feel. 

## Customizing the Theme

If you want to customize the site with your own CSS, the [CSS Editor](https://omeka.org/s/modules/CSSEditor/) module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, this theme includes variables and mixins for managing and extending many styles.

### Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

* **npm run start**: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
* **gulp css**: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.
* **gulp css:watch**: This task watches for changes in the Sass, then compiles the CSS.

## Utility classes
UC CAAN S offers a set of predefined utility classes that will help you to add styles to certain elements by just assigning them these classes.

You can even combine multiple utility classes.
